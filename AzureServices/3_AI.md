# Artificial Intelligence & Analytics

Microsoft Azure provides several AI and Analytics solutions

## Azure Synapse Analytics

Azure Synapse is an enterprise analytics service that accelerates time to insight across data warehouses and big data systems. Azure Synapse brings together the best of SQL technologies used in enterprise data warehousing, Spark technologies used for big data, Pipelines for data integration and ETL/ELT, and deep integration with other Azure services such as Power BI, CosmosDB, and AzureML.

## Azure HDInsight

Azure HDInsight is a cloud distribution of Hadoop components. HDInsight makes it easy, fast, and cost-effective to process massive amounts of data. You can use the most popular open-source frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, LLAP, Kafka, Storm, R, and more. With these frameworks, you can enable a broad range of scenarios such as extract, transform, and load (ETL), data warehousing, machine learning, and IoT.

## Azure Databricks

Azure Databricks is a data analytics platform optimized for the Microsoft Azure cloud services platform. Azure Databricks offers three environments for developing data intensive applications: Databricks SQL, Databricks Data Science & Engineering, and Databricks Machine Learning.

**Databricks SQL** provides an easy-to-use platform for analysts who want to run SQL queries on their data lake, create multiple visualization types to explore query results from different perspectives, and build and share dashboards.

**Databricks Data Science & Engineering** provides an interactive workspace that enables collaboration between data engineers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers. For a big data pipeline, the data (raw or structured) is ingested into Azure through Azure Data Factory in batches, or streamed near real-time using Apache Kafka, Event Hub, or IoT Hub. This data lands in a data lake for long term persisted storage, in Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage. As part of your analytics workflow, use Azure Databricks to read data from multiple data sources and turn it into breakthrough insights using Spark.

**Databricks Machine Learning** is an integrated end-to-end machine learning environment incorporating managed services for experiment tracking, model training, feature development and management, and feature and model serving.

## Azure Machine Learning

Azure Machine Learning is a platform for making predictions. It consists of tools and services that allow you to connect to data to train and test models to find one that will most accurately predict a future result. After you've run experiments to test the model, you can deploy and use it in real time via a web API endpoint. AML requires your own data to train eand evalute model.

## Azure Cognitive Services

[Azure Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/what-are-cognitive-services) provides prebuilt machine learning models that enable applications to see, hear, speak, understand. Azure Cognitive Services, for the most part, provides pretrained models so that you can bring in your live data to get predictions on.

## Azure Bot Service

Azure Bot Service and Bot Framework are platforms for creating virtual agents that understand and reply to human questions. Behind the scenes, the bot you build uses other Azure services, such as Azure Cognitive Services.
